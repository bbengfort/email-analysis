# Email Analysis Fixtures #

The fixtures in this directory are intended to be exemplary of the types
of data that are used in the analytical process. The `emailmetrics.csv`
file is an analgam of the CSV file that is generated by MineMyMail - in
fact it has been anonymized from my own personal MineMyMail output using
the `testdata` command of `m3stat`. You can use the anonymizer in your own
fixtures as well, leveraging the `mailstat.utils.testgen` module, or use
that module to generate random data for testing this module.

The other two fixtures- `names.txt` and `domains.txt` are used for the
random generation of email data for test analyses. You can find lists of
domains on the internet, as well as random name generators to create your
own fixtures.

Note that there are text fixtures in the tests directories that are used
for testing purposes only- they should not be touched except for developing
tests.
